### Requirements
As a web developer, I want to use the Vue CLI to deploy a static website so that I can make the big dollars. 

#### Acceptance Criteria
* A background image for the static website is set 
* `npm run build` was used to deploy the site
* Static site can be previewed using the file:// protocol 
  * All should resolve without error

#### Implementation Details
* __You may only use the style binding to accomplish this task__
  * I.e., you may not use an absolutely positioned image for the background 
* For the background, use the image located @ assets/background.jpg
* __You must also fix__ the hero image (hero.gif)
* __You may only use relative file paths__
  * I.e., you may not upload the image to S3 and serve it from there

#### Challenge

* Create a slideshow of background images using the assetss in /assets/challenge/
