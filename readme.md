# Vue Training Exercises

This repository contains exercises to help aid people in learning the Vue framework.

Each **branch** contains an exercise. The readme.md file at the root of the project contains instructions (in the form of a user story). 

## Prerequisites
You'll need node, npm (the node package manager), and the Vue CLI to run this project.

To install node, visit [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

To install npm, visit [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

To install the Vue CLI, you can use npm as follows:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
Please note that version 3 of the Vue CLI was used to create these exercises.

## Setup
To run any of these training exercises, you should only have to install dependencies using `npm i` 


## Usage
`git checkout BRANCHNAME` and then `npm run serve` to begin.

## Exercises

These exercises are structured so that a developer can follow along with the [offical Vue guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/). While the exercises do not have a 1-to-1 relationship with the topcis in the Vue guide, the exercises do follow the general order in which a developer would explore these topics.

It is recommended that you approach the exercises in this order:

| #  | Name                  | Branch Name                  |  
|:---| :-------------------: |:----------------------------:|
| 1  | Build a Static Site   | background-image-static-site | 
| 2  | Get API               | get-api                      |
| 3  | Form Validation       | form-validation              |
| 4  | Update User Data      | update-user-data             |
| 5  | Mortgage Calculator   | mortgage-calculator          |


### A note about each exercise's instructions
Each exercise was written as a [user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). If you're unfamiliar with them, this is a great chance to also practice your skills regarding interpreting and implementing requirements! 

Sometimes you may find that the "acceptance criteria" (AC) of a story are vague. As developers, we're tasked with providing very explicit instructions and often expect that level of specificity in our requirements. However, AC are sometimes written ambiguously - which can be a good thing! Rather than dictating every nuance of how to implement something, vague AC allows a project to rely on the developer's expertise to solve a problem. A developer can enjoy the freedom to pursue the solution that she or he believes is _best_. This works especially well in situations where the work needs to be done quickly (such as in [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)).

## Contributing
